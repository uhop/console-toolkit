# Documentation English Review

Review wiki and/or README files for brevity and clarity.

## Steps

1. List all markdown files in `wiki/` and note `README.md`.
2. For each file, read the full contents.
3. Edit prose for brevity and clarity:
   - Remove verbose preambles (e.g., "The module provides..." → direct description).
   - Replace "The following members are available:" → "Members:" or similar.
   - Shorten descriptions while preserving technical accuracy.
   - Fix typos and grammar issues.
4. **Do NOT change:**
   - Code examples or code blocks.
   - Markdown tables (content or formatting).
   - Technical terms, function signatures, or parameter names.
   - Comments in code blocks.
   - Links or image references.
5. After editing each file, move to the next. Track progress with the todo list.
6. When all files are done, provide a summary of changes.
